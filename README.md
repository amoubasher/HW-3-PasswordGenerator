Homework 3 - Password generator.

This challenge was made in order for students to practice their JS coding and to utilize what they learned from Module 3. The idea was to make an interactive application that 
would ask the user a series of questions in order to generate a new password for them. It starts out by asking the user how many charaters they would like their password to have.
Then, the page would ask if they would like any uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or special characters. The user could choose to omit any of the criteria, but they must choose at least one. As per the acceptance criteria for the assignment, the password must be between 8-128 characters, and the page must throw an error if the user decides to go with a different number. When everything is entered properly, the page will then present the user with a randomized password.

While going through this challenge, I had to resort to googling and asking questions from other students/tutors. It was a great learning experience and the first time I used JS to this extent. I had a lot of fun going through it and figuring out why an error message would pop up in the wrong place, or after all the prompts were answered. I would've liked to have to utilize loops more, as my understanding of them is not where I would like to be. Other than that I am proud I was able to make a program work.
